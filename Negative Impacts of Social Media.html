<h2>Unconcious Negative Impacts of Social Media</h2>
<ul>
    <li>People can use filters & photoshop to make themselves look better on social media</li>
    <ul>
        <li>“Growing up in the age of social media can give the children and young adults on these <br>
            apps insecurity over their features in photos. Users feel the need to correct themselves <br>
            to be acceptable for social media and are compelled to utilize an editing app before posting <br>
            on social media.” - Erika Ryan, Senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</li>
        <li>Not expressing who they are → Posting what they want to be</li>
        <li>Social Health involves having positive rewarding friendships with others</li>
        <li>Teens tend to make friends with ppl. across social media</li>
        <li>These friends that the teens have tend to appreciate the teens for who they appear to be 
            on social media, but not their true self</li>
        <li>Teens aren’t having rewarding friendships → Social health negatively affected</li>
        <li>Physical, mental, & social health linked → If one of these health components affected, 
            all will be affected eventually</li>
